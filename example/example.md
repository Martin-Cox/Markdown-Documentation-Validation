# AP

AP (Awesome Product) is really cool. It can load JSON files. For example if you have a file called `myFile.JSON` it will load it and display it in a pleasing manner.

## Enable Tests

AP can also enable tests things. An example of an enable test is `1 + 1 == 2`. By the way, buh. Also AP is really cool.
